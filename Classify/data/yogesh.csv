Many commonly repeated claims – such as mineral sunscreens not containing chemicals; that chemical sunscreens have been proven harmful; or that chemical sunscreens absorb UV, while mineral ones only reflect it – are misleading, even false.",Health202,"The confusion begins with terminology. ""Everything is a chemical,"" points out Brian Diffey, emeritus professor of photobiology in dermatological sciences at the UK's University of Newcastle and inventor of sunscreen's UVA star rating. What people call ""chemical"" filters are more accurately termed organic, since they contain carbon-hydrogen bonds, says Diffey. Inorganic filters (often called mineral), primarily titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, lack those bonds. All are chemicals. ",Health203,"At first, it was thought that organic sunscreens absorbed UVR, while inorganic sunscreens physically reflected and scattered UVR away from the skin – a belief that was perpetuated further in a 1970s United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monograph.",Health204,"""People say that mineral or inorganic sunscreens reflect ultraviolet radiation,"" says Antony Young, professor emeritus of experimental photobiology at King's College London and a lifelong researcher of sunscreen efficacy. ""And that's not true.""",Health205,"These data indicate clearly that these filters act primarily as UV-absorbing materials, and not as UV-scattering or UV-reflecting materials.""",Health206,"They're not even actually ""reflecting"" that 5%, adds Diffey: ""They scatter it."" UV rays aren't bounced off the surface of the inorganic particles. Instead, he says, ""the light rays go into the medium. They bounce around from the atoms or molecules. Some of them then will come back out again. And that's called scattering.",Health207,"Ultimately, says Mary Sommerlad, a consultant dermatologist based in London and British Skin Foundation spokesperson: ""You don't need to decide whether you want your UV energy to be absorbed or reflected, because they're working in pretty much the same way."" That is, by reducing how much UVR your skin absorbs to protect it from damage and risk of developing cancer.",Health208,"If organic and inorganic sunscreens work so similarly, why do they feel different?",Health209,"It comes down to solubility. Most organic filters are soluble, meaning their active ingredients can be dissolved in a medium like water or oil. Inorganic sunscreens are not: their particles remain intact. As a result, inorganic sunscreens can feel thicker and give a white cast, while organic filters can provide smoother, clearer formulations.",Health210,"Most organic UV filters operate at the surface of the skin, too. Because sunburns develop at the upper layers of the skin, a UV filter must bind to the stratum corneum in order to work, say experts. Like inorganic sunscreens, therefore, organic sunscreens absorb the vast majority of UV at the skin's surface. ",Health211,"But it is true that some organic filters are systemically absorbed. ""Some active ingredients will find their way through to the bloodstream,"" says Diffey. ""Whether or not that's doing us any harm or not remains to be seen."" ",Health212,"So far, there isn't good evidence that it is. ",Health213,"The vast majority of research finding risks of chemicals like oxybenzone has been performed on animals, using massive amounts. In one 2001 study that sparked concern about endocrine disruption, for example, baby rats were fed extremely large quantities of UV filters like oxybenzone for four days. Those that consumed oxybenzone had uteruses that were 23% larger than rats that didn't.",Health214,"But when later researchers put these numbers into perspective, they found that – to reach the same systemic concentration of oxybenzone the rats had – a human would need to apply a 6% oxybenzone sunscreen every day… for 277 years.",Health215,"Why are animals exposed to so much of a particular ingredient? Because it helps scientists determine the potential safety limit. ""The reason for these studies is to determine how much is safe,"" says Michelle Wong, chemist and author of the book The Science of Beauty who frequently tackles sunscreen myths online. As a result, ""they are always looking for an effect. They will generally use a large enough amount of the ingredient… to elicit some sort of effect.",Health216,"""If they don't, then they don't know where the line is.""",Health217,"So far, the threshold at which the ingredients pose a risk seems to be many times higher than the quantity in which people are using them. One scientific review published earlier this year found no evidence that UV filters like avobenzone and homosalate can damage DNA or cause cancer in humans – and that blood levels of these chemicals from topical sunscreen are far below the amount at which they might have an effect.",Health218,"Amongst the millions of tiny life forms living on and inside our bodies are countless species of fungi. Our skin is a mosaic of them, membranes inside the nose and vagina are full of them, and fungi even live alongside the bacteria inside our guts.",Health219,"While we might acquire some fungi from our mothers at birth, new fungi are also constantly entering our bodies; we ingest yeasts every time we drink beer or eat bread, and we inhale floating fungal spores with every breath. Many of these fungi are quickly killed off by our immune systems, but others are transient passengers or lifelong acquaintances.",Health220,"Lately, scientists have been exploring how our fungal inhabitants could even influence our brains and behaviour.",Health221,Doctors have long known that fungi can cause dangerous brain infections. But researchers are now also finding curious – albeit sometimes controversial – hints that these microbes might have other neurological effects on humans.,Health222,"The idea might evoke images of the human-zombifying fungus from HBO's apocalyptic series The Last of Us. But while scientists agree that the idea of fungi taking complete control over our bodies is implausible, they're earnestly investigating whether some fungi inside us could contribute to brain-damaging diseases suchy as Alzheimer's disease, or if gut-dwelling fungi could influence our behaviour and mental health.",Health223,"This is an emerging area of research, experts say, so there are more questions than answers. But these possibilities are important to study – both to understand the deep and complex relationships with the microbes within us and to explore new ways of boosting our health.",Health224,"In general, humans are pretty good at resisting fungi (our warm body temperature tends to make it hard for them to take hold). And many of the fungi that do might actually be good for us, possibly supporting our immune systems or helping wounds to heal, says microbiologist Matthew Olm of the University of Colorado Boulder, US. ""I would say fungi are definitely a critical part of being a healthy human,"" he says.",Health225,"But many other fungi can cause infections, from athlete's foot to thrush. This happens when we encounter new, harmful fungi in our environment or when fungi that naturally coexist with us are under certain conditions triggered to explode in abundance, says Rebecca Drummond, a fungal immunologist at the University of Birmingham, UK. ",Health226,"It's rare for fungi to reach the brain, thanks to protective barriers in the lungs and intestines, along with the brain's own defensive wall, the blood-brain barrier, and immune cells that are primed to destroy any fungi that slip through. But fungal brain infections do happen, and the number of cases has increased in recent decades.",Health227,"This is due to a growing number of people with weakened immune systems, Drummond says, partly because of the global spread of the immune-crippling virus HIV, especially in parts of Africa but also due to rising use of immune-suppressing medications in cancer patients and organ transplant recipients. ""The more of these immune-modulating drugs we use, we'll see more of these fungal infections,"" Drummond says.",Health228,"Fungi that infect the brain sometimes originate in the lungs, including Aspergillus or Cryptococcus, which we inhale as airborne spores that can germinate, grow and spread if left unchecked, Drummond says. Less often, common gut residents such as Candida albicans grow out of control and, once in the brain, branches out and produces nerve-killing toxins, Drummond adds. Cryptococcus, meanwhile, can grow into tumour-like masses. ""Obviously, that causes huge amounts of damage,"" she says.",Health229,"People who survive fungal infections of the brain are often left with long-term brain damage. Aids patients who have survived cryptococcal meningitis, which arises from a brain infection by Cryptococcus x, suffer vision impairments, memory loss and dizziness, says Drummond.",Health230,"Scientists have long known of the dangers of fungal brain infections. But in recent years, some have been exploring the possibility that fungi are getting into the brain much more frequently than previously believed, and may even be contributing to the loss of nerve cells that occurs in conditions like Alzheimer's disease.",Health231,"To Richard Lathe, a molecular biologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, some of the most interesting evidence for this theory comes from a handful of cases where fungal and other microbial brain infections were coincidentally discovered in people initially diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In several cases where doctors prescribed infection-fighting medication, ""the symptoms of dementia remitted"", Lathe says. ""Quite remarkably, some of them went back to work"". ",Health232,"Lathe believes that microbes slip across the blood-brain barrier quite frequently but are usually suppressed or killed in people with healthy immune systems. Because our immune systems weaken with age, that could allow microbes to accumulate in the brain, perhaps triggering nerve-killing inflammation. ""It's only when the immune system declines that you see damage,"" he says.",Health233,"Scientists have long linked Alzheimer's to a build-up of certain proteins in the brain, but there's now a growing debate over whether the presence of those proteins is the cause or merely a symptom of the disease. Lathe argues these proteins are actually produced as a defence mechanism against microbial intrusion, based on research suggesting the proteins have infection-fighting properties.  ",Health234,"Further evidence that brain-intruding microbes could be causing Alzheimer's comes from experiments in mice, where scientists have witnessed the fungus Candida albicans entering the brain after the rodents' immune systems were compromised. And in one pre-print study– which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists – Lathe and his colleagues examined brain slices from deceased healthy people and Alzheimer's patients. They found large quantities of bacteria, viruses and fungi in both groups – but more in the brains from patients who had Alzheimer's. ",Health235,"If microbes are indeed a factor in Alzheimer's, we may be able to mitigate or even prevent the disease by strengthening people's immune defences, for instance with vaccines that have been shown to boost general immunity. But this theory is young, Lathe says. ""It's a new idea.""",Health236,"And a debated one, too. Olm and others argue it's hard to rule out that the microbial genetic material may have appeared because of contamination, as fragments of microbes tend to be ubiquitous. Lathe finds that unlikely, though, pointing to reports that microbe fragments in brain tissue are just as abundant inside the samples as they are on the surface, whereas contamination from the air would mostly settle on the brain surface.",Health237,"Still, Olm says that finding more microbe fragments in Alzheimer's brains isn't proof that those microbes cause the disease. For instance, those people's brains might simply have had a weaker blood-brain barrier or some other issue, meaning more microbes entered their brains over time before being killed off by their immune systems. ",Health238,"However, new evidence that microbes can invade the brains of animals like fish strengthens the notion that this could be happening in mammals – and perhaps even humans, Olm says. In a 2024 study, scientists labelled bacteria with tiny, fluorescent green molecules and added them to tanks housing salmon and trout. ""After a week, you see these microbes making their way into the fish brain, lighting the fish brain up green,"" Olm says, and curiously, ""[the microbes] seemingly live there without huge consequences for these fish over their lifetime."" ",Health239,"In any case, the notion of fungi and other microbes getting into the brain in old age – either due to a weakening brain immune system or a worn-out blood brain barrier – is more plausible. ""I think we've now reached that threshold where there's enough smoke around this hypothesis… it's worth spending money on figuring out if that is happening,"" Olm says.",Health240,"Mohan Gupta had never dreamed of becoming a comedian. Born in India and educated in the UK, he trained as engineer and, later, a monk. ""I never in my life thought I would make anyone laugh,"" he says.  ",Health241,"But a few years ago, after suffering a nervous breakdown, Gupta's doctors prescribed him something unusual: a stand-up comedy course.  ",Health242,"Laughter has long been linked to a variety of health gains: it can both reduce stress, and increase immunity, focus, and cardiovascular function. Yet research now suggests that not just consuming comedy, but actively creating it – especially in a group setting – can offer significant benefits to mental health in particular.",Health243,"In the UK, new programmes are beginning to use stand-up comedy lessons to help people in distress. They come as part of a larger global movement of social prescribing: a process through which health workers refer patients to non-clinical, community-based resources and activities, as a way to both improve patients' long-term health and reduce pressure on healthcare.  ",Health244,"When both her mother and mother-in-law then became ill at the same time and she couldn't take care of them, she sank to the lowest she'd ever felt, she says, and began to have suicidal thoughts.

She attributes these anecdotes to the role humour plays in developing  healthy societies and families.

After four years of therapy, Moore decided to give Belcher's comedy-on-referral course a try. On his first day, he wasn't sold. ""I was the youngest guy there and I looked around and wondered if this was beneath me,"" he admits. But then, as the men started talking about their traumas, his mindset shifted. ""It was like an arrow had gone through every single person's heart and I realised we're all sort of the same.""",Health258,"Moore says the comedy prescription has been better for his mental health than any other kind of therapy or pill. And more than just comedic skills and coping mechanisms, he's made friends he otherwise wouldn't have. ""It's really special to have that connection with guys I would never meet or speak to in a pub.""",Health259,"Moore says the group has also helped him shift his perspective on himself. ""There's this victimhood mentality where you carry [your pain] around on your shoulders and it weighs you down every single day,"" he says.

She says it sometimes takes a group longer to reveal their vulnerabilities, and she's had to learn to adjust her pace. Other times, she finds a person takes the course too soon and needs more time and distance from their traumatic experience.",Health264,"But for those who can't access formal comedy prescription, Ben-Moshe offers tips for people to use humour as a tool to cope with stress and spark joy. ""Each day, ask yourself: 'Where was there a moment of levity, silliness or playfulness today?' Write it down or share it, since this trains your internal humour radar.""",Health265,"If possible, she suggests people make it a habit to share a funny story, joke, or video with those around them.

Today most of us sprinkle it on our food as a seasoning, often without even thinking.",Health267,But adding black pepper to your meal might be doing more than simply adding flavour. It might be boosting the amount of nutrients you are getting from your food. ,Health268,Peppercorns contain a chemical that helps vitamins and other nutrients be absorbed more easily into the bloodstream.

Scientists are now trying to harness these effects to develop new types of fortified foods and help people who struggle to absorb the nutrients they need to stay healthy.,Health269,"One of the problems we face with even the most nutrient-rich foods is whether our bodies are able to extract the vitamins and minerals as they pass through our digestive system. Take sweetcorn, for example. Sweetcorn kernels are undoubtedly packed with goodness – high in fibre, protein, vitamins and micronutrients like potassium. But anyone who has peered into the toilet bowl after a meal of corn kernels will wonder how much of that nourishment they have absorbed. The waxy outer casing of the kernel is hard for our bodies to break down, especially if we don't chew it properly first.",Health270,"When you eat sweetcorn [without adequately chewing] it passes all the way through your gastrointestinal tract and ends up in your toilet, and all the nutrients inside are still trapped in there,"" says David Julian McClements, professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts, US.",Health271,"Luckily, by chewing sweetcorn, we can free the nutrient filled flesh inside so it can be digested.",Health272,"""Oil soluble vitamins don't dissolve in water, so if you ate them and you didn't have any fat with your food they wouldn't dissolve, and they would just go through your gastrointestinal tract and out into poop,"" says McClements.",Health273,"""If you eat them [vitamins] with some fat, the fat gets broken down and it forms these tiny nano-sized particles called micelles inside your gastrointestinal tract,"" says McClements.
